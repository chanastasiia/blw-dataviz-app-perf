        How well do Americans think the United States is performing _as a
        democracy_? This isn't a straightforward question to answer, because
        democracy is a multi-faceted concept, and people have different ideas
        about which aspects of politics and government count as "democratic".
        So, to measure Americans' assessments of U.S. democracy, Bright Line
        Watch has developed a list of 31 democratic principles designed to
        encompass the broadest possible conception of democracy. On the previous
        screen, you gave _your_ assessment of U.S. performance on three of those
        31 principles.

        Starting in 2017, Bright Line Watch began asking large samples of
        Americans to share their assessments of the U.S. on each of the 31
        principles. In this app, you'll explore the results, based on over
        55,000 survey responses.{" "}
