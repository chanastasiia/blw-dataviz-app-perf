  2. Create an additional object that stores the point radius for each view
  3. Remove the radius property from every point.

  Then, change the return statement below so it returns BOTH the sample

  (1) the radius for each view and (2) the total viz height for each view.
  Clearly, this object will have a property for each view.

  round off all coordinates to whole numbers s(sub-pixel units slows browser performance)
